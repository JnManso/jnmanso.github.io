Previously worked as a consultant for Microsoft Services to help it's costumers. Now I'm developing products for using around the world.

I'm a software developer, problem solver, continuous learner who likes to improve my skills every day and feeling that my style code evolves. But the best way to learn is to teach, so I like to be a mentor and make some presentations. Visual Studio shortcuts addict.

I'm a proud member of the .net group in portugal: www.NetPonto.org where I'm a member for over 4 years now and we still keep doing monthly meetings.
