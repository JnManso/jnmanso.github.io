This week I had to learn more about the&nbsp;Change Tracking (CT)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Change Data Capture (CDC) that was introduced in SQL Server 2008.

To learn more about the subject I read the 3 articles written by&nbsp;<a title="Chandra Sekhar" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Members/SQLVERSITY" target="_blank">Chandra Sekhar</a>.

<strong>1)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/537649/SQL-Server-Change-Tracking-CT" target="_blank">Change Tracking (CT)</a></strong>

<blockquote><strong>Background:</strong>

Prior to SQL Server 2008, developers had to create some custom tracking solutions using DML Trigger and additional tables to track the data which we have modified.
<ul>
 	<li>DML Triggers: These are the part of our transaction which contains the DML by which it is triggered. As we all know that, triggers are very expensive and we are using them in our transaction, the execution time will increase so that the performance of our project will be affected<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></li>
 	<li>Additional tables: By running the above DML triggers, we are able to track the data. But there is nothing to store these changes. To store this changed data, we need to create these additional tables. These tables will have similar columns as the tables which we need to track.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Drawbacks</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Takes much time to develop/create DML triggers and additional tables</li>
 	<li>Performance hit</li>
 	<li>Very complex process</li>
</ul>
<h4>SQL Server 2008</h4>
To overcome the above drawbacks, SQL Server 2008 introduced powerful and efficient tracking mechanisms called<strong>&nbsp;Change Tracking (CT)&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Change data Capture (CDC)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
<h4><strong>Similarities:</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Both Track DML changes</li>
 	<li>Both Track whether column data has changes or not</li>
 	<li>Required to enable them on table as well as on database</li>
</ul>
